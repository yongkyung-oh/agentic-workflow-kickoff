## Scaling

As sessions accumulate:

- **Subfolders by month**: `sessions/2026-02/`, `sessions/2026-03/` etc.
- **Archive old sessions**: move to `sessions/archive/` when no longer referenced
- **Latest Handoff is always current**: this is the only block Claude reads at session start — never let it go stale
